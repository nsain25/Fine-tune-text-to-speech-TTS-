# Fine-tune-text-to-speech-TTS-

Objective:
The purpose of this assignment is to fine-tune two text-to-speech (TTS) models. One model will be optimized to handle technical jargon commonly used in English technical interviews, such as "API," "CUDA," and "TTS." The other model will be fine-tuned for a regional language of your choice. You will also explore ways to optimize the model for fast inference, and investigate techniques such as quantization to reduce model size without compromising performance.
