# Fine-tune-text-to-speech-TTS-

Objective:
This assignment aims to fine-tune two text-to-speech (TTS) models. One model will be optimized to handle technical jargon commonly used in English technical interviews, such as "API," "CUDA," and "TTS." The other model will be fine-tuned for a regional language of your choice. You will also explore ways to optimize the model for fast inference, and investigate techniques such as quantization to reduce model size without compromising performance.

Introduction:
Text-to-speech (TTS) technology is a crucial component of modern applications, allowing machines to convert written text into human-like speech. TTS is widely used in virtual assistants, accessibility tools for visually impaired users, automated customer support, and many more applications. Fine-tuning a pre-trained TTS model enhances its ability to handle specific domains, such as technical speech or regional languages, making the synthesized speech more natural and contextually accurate.

The goal of this project was to fine-tune a pre-trained TTS model, SpeechT5, for two key purposes:

English Technical Speech: To ensure proper pronunciation and naturalness for technical jargon.
A Regional Language Model: To enable speech synthesis in a non-English language, using synthetic data or publicly available datasets.
Methodology:
Model Selection:
We selected the SpeechT5 model from Hugging Face, which is designed for TTS tasks. It supports text input and outputs mel-spectrograms, which are then converted into audible speech. The model was pre-trained on English datasets and required fine-tuning to improve its performance for specific tasks.

Dataset Preparation:
English Technical Speech: A synthetic dataset containing technical sentences was created. This dataset included common phrases and technical terminology to ensure the model correctly synthesized words like "API," "OAuth," and "CUDA."
Regional Language (Hindi): Due to dataset limitations, a minimal synthetic dataset was created with a couple of Hindi sentences. Fine-tuning aimed to improve the model's ability to generate speech in this regional language.

Fine-tuning Process:
Preprocessing: The text was tokenized into input IDs and attention masks using the SpeechT5Processor. We ensured proper padding and tokenization for model compatibility.
Custom Training Loop: Initially, we attempted to use Hugging Face's Trainer, but encountered errors related to shape mismatches in input dimensions and model outputs. To resolve this, we implemented a custom training loop, manually handling forward passes, loss calculations, and backpropagation.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss was used to compare the predicted mel-spectrograms with synthetic ground-truth spectrograms.
Optimizer: AdamW was selected as the optimizer, with a learning rate of 5e-5.

Results:
Objective Evaluations:
English Technical Speech: The model successfully synthesized technical sentences, with accurate pronunciation of jargon and abbreviations. However, there was some variation in the naturalness of longer technical phrases, which could be further improved with a more extensive dataset.

Regional Language (Hindi): The model struggled with the limited dataset provided, as fine-tuning with only a few synthetic examples did not yield high-quality results. This highlights the need for a larger, more diverse dataset for regional language fine-tuning.

Subjective Evaluations:
For English technical speech, users reported that the modelâ€™s pronunciation of technical terms was accurate, but the naturalness of the speech could be further enhanced.
For the regional language model, the speech was intelligible, but lacked the prosody and fluency expected from natural Hindi speech synthesis.

Challenges:
Dataset Issues: The primary challenge was the lack of large, diverse datasets for both technical speech and the regional language. Synthetic data helped test the model, but it lacked the richness needed for high-quality speech synthesis.
Model Convergence: Training the model with a small dataset often led to poor convergence, especially for the regional language. The model required more training data for meaningful improvements.
Shape Mismatch Errors: We encountered several shape mismatch errors during the use of the Hugging Face Trainer class. These were resolved by switching to a custom training loop, which allowed for more control over data handling and model inputs.

Future Work:
Dataset Expansion: Future work should focus on collecting or creating larger datasets for both technical speech and regional languages. Crowdsourced or publicly available datasets like Common Voice could be used to improve regional language fine-tuning.
Model Architecture Improvements: Exploring other TTS architectures like Coqui TTS or Tacotron 2 could offer better results for domain-specific and regional language synthesis.
Fast Inference Optimization: Implementing techniques like quantization or model pruning could help reduce the model size and improve inference speed, making the system more suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion:
The fine-tuning of the SpeechT5 model for both English technical speech and a regional language (Hindi) demonstrated the potential of TTS models to handle domain-specific tasks. While the results were promising for technical English speech, the regional language model highlighted the need for larger datasets and more complex training.

Key takeaways include:
Fine-tuning significantly improves domain-specific performance, but the quality of the output is closely tied to the size and diversity of the dataset.
Custom training loops offer flexibility in handling issues such as shape mismatches, but require careful management of inputs and model parameters.
Future improvements should focus on expanding datasets, optimizing model architectures, and improving inference speed for real-time applications.
